                <h3>Jaigarh Fort, Jaipur Overview</h3>
                <p>Jaigarh Fort is a grand structure perched on the top of the 'Cheel ka Teela' hills in the Pink City of
                    Jaipur. This
                    magnificent edifice was commissioned by Sawai Jai Singh II in the year 1726 to protect Amer Fort.
                    Cradled on the top of
                    the cliff, it is a palatial structure bounded by verdant greenery and massive battlements. This
                    magnificent fort is
                    connected to Amer Fort through subterranean passages and is famously known as the 'Fort of Victory' as
                    it was never
                    conquered. The fort currently houses the world's largest cannon on wheels - 'Jaivana' and offers a
                    magnificent view of
                    the Jaipur city.
                    <br><br>
                    Conceptualized and designed by a talented architect called Vidhyadhar, Jaigarh fort is said to be the
                    strongest of all
                    the three forts and has never faced any major resistance. The fort reflects the city's prosperous past
                    and is named
                    after the ruler who got it built - Sawai Jai Singh II. Other than its elaborate architecture, the fort
                    is also known for
                    the huge treasure that was believed to be buried under it. However, it is believed that the treasure was
                    seized by the
                    government of Rajasthan in the 1970s.

                    <h4>History of Jaigarh fort :</h4>
                    <p>Jaigarh Fort is a magnificent architecture built during the early 18th century. Jaigarh including the
                        Amer fort was
                        located in the city of Amer which was ruled by the Kachawahas from the early 10th century.
                        The fort became the main cannon foundry during the Mughal dynasty and was also used to store
                        ammunition and other metal
                        required for war. The cannon outpost at the Jaigarh fort was protected during the successive wars
                        that broke out in the
                        Mughal dynasty in 1658 until the protector, Dara Shikoh, was defeated and executed by his own
                        brother, Aurangzeb.
                        Later the great 'Jaivana Cannon', along with using the devices and the foundries is known to have
                        been moulded by Jai
                        Singh II when the fort was handed over to him.

                    <h4>Architecture of Jaigarh fort :</h4>
                    <p>Jaigarh Fort is an imposing and remarkable structure spreading across a vast range. Protected by
                        thick walls of red
                        sandstone, the fort houses some of the most exquisite architectures including Lalit Mandir, Vilas
                        Mandir, Laxmi Vilas
                        and Aram Mandir. Two other temples, Ram Harihar built in 10th century and Kal Bhairav temple built
                        in the 12th century
                        add to the fascination of the fort. However, the main highlight of the place is world's greatest
                        cannon on wheels known
                        as the 'Jaivana Cannon' and a vast palace complex. Other than that, one can witness a well-tended
                        garden along with an
                        armory and a museum.
                        <br><br>
                        The red sandstone walls of the Jaigarh Fort are spread over a length of 3 kilometres and are about a
                        kilometer wide,
                        making the establishment an impregnable one. A well tended square garden sits within the bounds of
                        the fort and
                        embankments are constructed to provide access to the upper levels of the structure. Courtrooms and
                        halls are delicately
                        embellished with screened windows while a central watch tower overlooks the entire surrounding
                        landscape. The entry to
                        the Aram Mandir is through the Awani Darwaza which is a magnificent triple - arched entrance. Aram
                        Mandir provides an
                        exquisite view of the Sagar Lake located nearby.
