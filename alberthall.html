            <h3>Albert Hall Museum, Jaipur Overview</h3>
            <p>Situated in the Ram Niwas Garden of Jaipur, the Albert Hall Museum is the oldest museum in Rajasthan. Built
                in 1876, it
                was initially envisioned to be a concert hall and resembles the architecture of the Victoria and Albert Hall
                Museum in
                London, hence, the name. It is a standing example of the Indo-Saracenic architecture and is also known as
                Government
                Central Museum. Albert Hall Museum has an extensive collection of artefacts brought from the different
                regions of the
                world that are divided over a whopping 16 art galleries! The museum takes on a whole new facade as the night
                falls and
                the entire building glows with yellow lights, which looks extremely beautiful. You can relax in the gardens
                with the
                stunning view of Albert Hall in the backdrop. It is certainly a great place to get a peek into the history
                and ancient
                culture of India.
                <br><br>
                Flanked by lush green gardens, the foundation of Albert Hall was laid on 6 February 1876 when Albert Edward
                visited
                India. The galleries of the museum have a collection of antiques and artefacts from the past that will blow
                away your
                mind. The ancient coins, marble art, pottery, carpets and especially the Egyptian mummy are a treat to the
                eyes of
                history buffs. The building itself from the outside has an alluring architecture. The Indo - Saracenic
                inspired domes
                and intricately carved arches constructed from sandstone is mesmerizing.

                <h4>History of Albert Hall Museum :</h4>
                <p>The foundation of Albert Hall was laid during the visit of the Prince of Wales, Albert Edward to Jaipur
                    in 1876. It was
                    not sure how the building would be used. On the suggestion of Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II in 1880, a
                    temporary museum
                    was built in 1881 to display the products of local craftsmen. The Albert Hall was completed in 1887 by
                    the architect,
                    Samuel Swinton Jacob, Director of Jaipur PWD. The temporary museum, whose artefacts were collected from
                    several parts of
                    India and its neighbours were shifted in the new museum.
                    <br><br>
                    The building became a fine example of Indo-Saracenic architecture. The corridors were decorated with
                    murals in a variety
                    of styles and European, Egyptian, Chinese, Greek and Babylonian civilizations were portrayed to enable
                    the visitors to
                    develop their knowledge of art and history. Thus, Albert Hall became a centre for imparting knowledge of
                    the history of
                    civilizations, inspiring artisans to enhance their skills and preserving & developing traditional Indian
                    arts, crafts
                    and architectural forms.

                <h4>Gallery Collections at Albert Hall Museum :</h4>
                <p>The Albert Hall Museum has different amusing galleries which showcase antiques and treasures from the
                    nineteenth
                    century. Some of them are-
                    <br><br>
                    1. Carpet Gallery- The collection has the 'Persian Garden Carpet' which is the best example of Persian
                    garden carpets in
                    the world. Purchased at the time of Mirza Raja Jai Singh I in 1632 A.D, the carpet depicts the scene of
                    a Persian
                    garden. It is divided into four parts which are sub-divided into many sections. Each part with different
                    colours makes
                    the carpet look magnificent. Fishes, birds, turtles and other Chinese animals can also be seen. The
                    gallery also has
                    doormats, circular carpets with Mughal and floral patterns.

                    belonging to Akbar,
                    Jehangir, Shahjahan and Aurangzeb's reigns were discovered in various parts of Rajasthan. It is
