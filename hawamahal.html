                <h3>Hawa Mahal, Jaipur Overview</h3>
                <p>The massive edifice of Hawa Mahal stands at the intersection of the main road in Jaipur, Badi Chaupad and
                    was built by
                    Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh in the year 1799. Hawa Mahal derives its name from its unique structure,
                    which is a mesh of
                    small windows that allowed cool wind to enter the palace and hence kept the palace comfortable during
                    the hot summer
                    months. The main reason behind the palace's construction was to allow the women of the royal house to
                    observe the
                    festivities on the streets whilst being unseen from the outside as was the custom of the land. It is
                    located right on
                    the edge of the City Palace Jaipur and extends right to the 'zenana'.
                    <br><br>
                    Hawa Mahal is a structure made of red and pink sandstone and has a pyramidal structure which almost
                    resembles a crown.
                    It has been embellished with 953 tiny windows, also known as 'Jharokhas' and embellished with gorgeous
                    latticework. From
                    within, the Hawa Mahal palace is based on five floors each of which has a uniquely decorated chamber. A
                    charming
                    fountain welcomes you inside the main palace, from whereon you can make your way up to the different
                    floors. The top of
                    the palace offers a brilliant view of the City Palace, Jantar Mantar and the ever-busy Siredeori Bazar.
                    There is a small
                    museum as well which holds some rich relics and miniature paintings.

                    <h4>History of Hawa Mahal :</h4>
                    <p>Hawa Mahal was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh as a continuation of the royal City
                        Palace and was designed
                        by Lal Chand Ustad in the form of Krishna's crown. In those days, the Rajputs used to follow the
                        Purdah system and the
                        royal women did not appear in front of the public. As they wished to follow the day to day events,
                        the Hawa Mahal was
                        built with extremely small windows and screened balconies to provide a sense of freedom among the
                        women.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Architecture of Hawa Mahal :</h4>
                    <p>The reason behind the naming of Hawa Mahal is the structure of the building. It is a unique five
                        storey Palace which
                        looks similar to a honeycomb because of the 953 small windows called jharokhas, and these windows
                        allow the breeze to
                        flow in and helps in keeping the palace cool. The Hawa Mahal is the tallest building in the world
                        without foundation and
                        because of the lack of one, the palace is tilted at an angle of 87 degrees. Hawa Mahal stands at an
                        elevation of 50 feet
                        above the ground and has small portholes which consist of miniature windows and sandstone grills.
                        The building has no
                        stairs inside and one needs to climb up the ramps to reach the top.
                        <br><br>
                        In order to enter the Palace, you need to get through an Imperial door which is situated towards the
                        left of the
                        building. It gives way to a large courtyard which has three double storeyed buildings towards the
                        left, right and
                        centre. The top three floors of the Hawa Mahal are only the width of one room, while the first and
                        second floors have
                        courtyards in front of them. The rooms themselves are decorated with colourful mosaics of glasses,
                        ornamental stonework
                        and 'chhatris' which are a part of the traditional Rajasthani architecture.

                    <h4>Shopping At Hawa Mahal :</h4>
                    <p>A number of small shops are situated right outside the palace premises, where you can buy a wide
                        variety of gift items
                        as well as items of daily use. This vast shopping area is better known as Badi Chaupal or Manek
                        Chowk and is a central
                        point in the city. Articles such as traditional clothing, jewellery, showpieces, vase, traditional
                        footwear or 'juttis',
                        key chains and many such items are quite easily available here. You can also buy dress materials
                        with Jaipuri print,
                        sarees, jewellery, handicrafts, Rajasthani furniture and antiques here. A number of street vendors
                        also sell delicious
                        snacks like golgappas, bhelpuri, samosas and kachoris which are delightfully delicious. There is a
                        cafe opposite Hawa
                        Mahal that gives a great view of this architectural marvel.
