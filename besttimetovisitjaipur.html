                <h5 style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: 450;">Rajasthan’s prestigious pink city, shrouded in royalty
                    and heritage, ranks high on a globetrotter’s
                    travel bucket list.
                    And, for good reason too! From its world-famous monuments to its ornate temples, grandiose palaces
                    and aesthetic forts,
                    the majesty is unparalleled.
                    <br><br>
                    This diversity and variability percolates into its seasons too. So, when the question of ‘what is
                    the best time to visit
                    Jaipur’ arises, one must consider every detail. From the boon to the bane and everything in between,
                    it’s imperative to
                    be aware of each period. Jaipur’s pronounced seasons of winter, summer and monsoon go through a
                    gamut of changes. The
                    frost shapeshifts into warmth that eventually transforms into moisture. With each division of the
                    year comes a different
                    set of activities, events and festivals. The city dons many hats and there’s always something unique
                    to experience
                    through the year.
                </h5>
    
                <h2 style="color: #5267f5;">Jaipur in Winter (November to February):</h2>
    
                <p><strong>Temperature –</strong> The air temperature during the season of winter fluctuates between 8°C
                    and 26°C.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Weather –</strong> The weather of Jaipur in winter is pleasant and amicable. During the
                    mornings and the evenings, the city is cloaked in a
                    dense cover of mist and fog. The days are graced with a lovely sunshine, rendering it a pleasing
                    time to explore, wander
                    and sightsee. The nights get particularly chilly, as temperatures fall to singular digits. All in
                    all, this season is a
                    comfortable time to visit.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Significance –</strong> Tis the season to immerse oneself in a host of thrilling things!
                    Jaipur during winter is simply animated and magical.
                    Here are some of the recommended experiences for you - Riding an elephant at Amer Fort, cycling
                    around Nahargarh Fort,
                    strolling through medieval streets/bazaars, partaking in festivals such as the Jaipur Literature
                    Fest. The possibilities
                    are endless.
                </p>
    
                <p><strong>Why you should visit now –</strong> Just like other cities in Rajasthan, Jaipur exudes
                    wonderful charm during the months of winter. One can take in the
                    opulent forts, palaces and monuments with more clarity and ease. The cityscape and architecture look
                    enchanting as the
                    atmosphere is crisp and fresh, accentuated by the chill in the air. The climate is ideal for
                    strolling and touring
                    without the hassles of heat or humidity. As such, this is the best climate to visit Jaipur in for an
                    exceptional
                    holiday.</p>
    
    
                <p><strong>Things to know before the visit –</strong>Winter is peak tourist season. As such, travel will
                    be a little more expensive.Jaipur Tour packages, accommodation and
                    the likes will require prior booking. There are medium priced and budget hotels available for those
                    who aren’t seeking
                    luxury. Service personnel, be it porters, waiters or guides expect to be tipped at least 10%.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Tips –</strong> While sightseeing, opt for a rikshaw or a taxi. However, be sure to agree on
                    the price before hopping on. When it comes
                    to your attire, it goes without saying that you need to be fully clad. Dress in layers so that you
                    can shed some when
                    you feel warm.</p>
    
    
                <br><br><br>
    
    
                <h2 style="color: #5267f5;">Jaipur in Winter Summer (March to June):</h2>
    
                <p><strong>Temperature –</strong> The air temperature during the season of summer fluctuates between
                    24°C and 39°C.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Weather –</strong> True to the Rajasthani summer blaze, Jaipur experiences blistering
                    weather. Hot winds and humidity make it extremely
                    uncomfortable to traverse the region during this time. As such, sightseeing gets harder. The days
                    are scorching,
                    eventually giving way to relatively comfortable evenings.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Significance –</strong> Rajasthani summers are synonymous with its season friendly food and
                    drink such as Sugarcane Juice, Lemonade, Coconut
                    water, Buttermilk, Watermelon and Muskmelon. Imagine treating your palette to these cooling items,
                    whilst enjoying the
                    views that luxurious palace hotels provide? Yes, one can revel in the stunning infinity pools and
                    platforms/gazebos/verandas at Jaipur’s best hotels. Summer is the perfect time for some indulgence
                    and pool action! But
                    it doesn’t stop here. Jaipur, being a cultural city, hosts some delightful festivals such as
                    Gangaur.
                </p>
    
                <p><strong>Why you should visit now –</strong> Although the season of summer can be particularly
                    unbearable, there are advantages of visiting the city during this
                    time. Apart from the commercial tourist spots, best place to visit in Jaipur are Night Bazaar in
                    Chaura Rasta, Albert
                    Hall, Snow World and the Light & Sound Show. The excitement is hard to ignore!
                </p>
    
    
                <p><strong>Things to know before the visit –</strong>This is the best season to visit Jaipur in, for
                    affordable prices at luxury hotels. In-fact, most hotels offer discounts
                    to attract a larger crowd. Furthermore, this is the least rainy destination in the country for
                    family vacations. To add
                    to this, the queues are shorter, the traffic is far less, and accommodation is hassle free. However,
                    there is great risk
                    of heat exhaustion and heat strokes during this time so stay hydrated.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Tips –</strong> Make sure you pack all the essentials to help beat the heat. Your luggage
                    should consist of airy clothing, sunscreen,
                    sunglasses, hats, water bottles etc. Never leave the hotel on an empty stomach. Eat well and stay
                    hydrated but try
                    avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Plan your sightseeing timings according to the climate, which means
                    early mornings or
                    evenings.</p>
    
    
                <br><br><br>
    
    
    
                <h2 style="color: #5267f5;">Jaipur in Winter Monsoon (July to October):</h2>
    
                <p><strong>Temperature –</strong> The air temperature during the season of monsoon fluctuates between
                    23°C and 34°C.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Weather –</strong> The monsoon climate is far more alluring than that of summer. Temperatures
                    are significantly less hot; winds are cooler,
                    and the existence of rain creates the illusion of mystique and wonder. This is an ideal time to
                    enjoy gorgeous views,
                    sprinkled with buttery drizzles.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Significance –</strong> Jaipur won’t rain on your parade, should you choose to visit it
                    during this season. You can choose a snug spot to marvel
                    at the picture-perfect landscapes drenched in crystal drops, whilst savouring delectable Rajasthani
                    snacks. And, this is
                    just the beginning! Partake in the colourful and auspicious festival of Teej, during which street
                    stalls sell delicious
                    Ghevar. Visit Jal Mahal, an exquisite water palace and Chokhi Dhani, a haven for cultural
                    enthusiasts. Spend a night at
                    the earthy Tree House Resort and live out your glamping fantasy. Monsoon mania is so much fun!
                </p>
    
                <p><strong>Why you should visit now –</strong> The romantic season of monsoon is perhaps the best time
                    to observe the pink city in its most natural hue. The rain has a
                    way of making everything look more beautiful, more refreshing. From the sounds and smells to the
                    gush of shimmering
                    water, a city falls prey to the mystical charms of the monsoon Gods. And, Jaipur is one such city
                    that embraces this
                    ever so brilliantly!
                </p>
    
    
                <p><strong>Things to know before the visit –</strong>August is the rainiest month of the season. Take
                    this into account, while planning your day tours and outdoor
                    excursions. Also, there is the risk of dust storms occurring during this time. On a lighter note,
                    this period is
                    shoulder season. As such, prices will be affordable, and hotels will offer great deals.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Tips –</strong> Your clothing should account for the season. Carry an umbrella, windcheater
                    and gumboots. Ensure your gadgets are
                    waterproof!</p>
