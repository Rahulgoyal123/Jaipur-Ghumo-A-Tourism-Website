            <h3>Jal Mahal, Jaipur Overview</h3>
            <p>Sitting prettily right in the centre of the Man Sagar Lake on the outskirts of Jaipur, lies the splendid and
                tranquil
                Jal Mahal. A masterful creation, it is bordered by the Nahargarh Hills. This low rise symmetrical Palace was
                once a
                shooting lodge for the Maharajas and now fascinates many visitors from all over the world. Jal Mahal was
                constructed in
                the 1750s and was commissioned by Maharaja Madho Singh. It is indeed one of the most photographed monuments
                in India.
                The most striking feature of this palace is that while only one storey appears above the water level, there
                are in fact
                4 storeys submerged underneath.
                <br><br>
                It is one of the most beautiful architectural palaces built by combining the Mughal and Rajput styles of
                architecture.
                The entry inside the fort is prohibited, but the view from a considerable distance while boating is enough
                to mesmerize
                you. During the evenings, the fort lights up and the reflection of the fort in the lake is absolutely
                gorgeous. With its
                impressive beauty and laid-back ambience, the Jal Mahal has become a true tourist delight.

                <h4>History of Jal Mahal :</h4>
                <p>The history of Jal Mahal is quite ambiguous, and it is not clear as to who exactly built the Palace. It
                    is believed that
                    Jal Mahal, which means 'Water Palace' was built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh in the year 1799 to serve
                    as a lodge for
                    duck hunting. It is also surmised that Maharaja Madho Singh I constructed the palace in the year 1750.
                    It was never
                    intended to be used as a palace. Later, the beauty of the palace was enhanced by Maharaja Jai Singh II
                    of Amber who
                    renovated and added some more structures to it. The Man Sagar Lake was also formed by Maharaja Sawai
                    Pratap Singh from
                    constructing a dam.

                <h4>Architecture of Jal Mahal :</h4>
                <p>Jal Mahal, a five-storey palace is inspired by the Rajput style of architecture. With four floors
                    submerged in water,
                    only the fifth floor is visible. It is built from red sandstone and four octagon-shaped chhatris are
                    located at the
                    corners of the palace. It was renovated by Maharaja Jai Singh II in the 18th century and has total
                    twenty-one
                    beautifully carved pillars which are the cenotaphs of the royal family. There is a garden on the roof
                    called Chameli
                    Bagh. A platform in the centre of the garden was used for recitals and dance performers. Though the
                    original garden is
                    damaged, it has been created again. Visitors are not allowed to enter inside the temple. You can just
                    praise its beauty
                    from a distance.

                    &emsp; The Water Palace nestled amidst Nahargarh Hills and submerged in Man Sagar
                    Lake looks beautiful at sunrise and sunset.
                    You can just sit and enjoy the scenic view as it unfolds in front of you.<br><br>

                    khadi shops.<br><br>

                    &emsp;The bumpy and thrilling camel ride is also an option
                </p>
            </div>
            <div style="padding: 20px;">
                <h4>Jal Mahal - Bird Watcher's Paradise :</h4>
                <p>Jal Mahal or Water Palace which stands on the Man Sagar Lake was a dream come true for bird-watchers. It
                    was a home for
                    various migratory and local birds like flamingos, great crested grebe, pintail, pochards, kestrel etc.
                    Unfortunately, as
                    the quality of the lake went down, their numbers declined. However, with the restoration work
                    undertaken, some birds can
                    be found at Man Sagar Lake like common moorhen, grey heron, White-browed wagtail and Blue-tailed
                    bee-eaters. An annual
                    birding fair is also held to increase awareness about the lake's condition.
                </p>

            <div style="padding: 20px;">
                <h4>Jal Mahal Timings and Entry Fees :</h4>
                <p>The entry to Jal Mahal has been restricted since it was declared a protected area by the government. The
                    boat ride
                    around the palace has also been stopped. However, it is an amazing place to spend some peaceful time in
                    the midst of
                    beauty and nature. There is a pathway which surrounds the Man Sagar Lake from where tourists can view
                    the Jal Mahal. It
                    has no entry fee, and you can spend as much time as you like but only during the day time (6:00 AM to
                    6:00 PM)
