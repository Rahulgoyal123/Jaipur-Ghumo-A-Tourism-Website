            <h3>Amer Fort Overview</h3>
            <p>Cradled on the top of a hill near Jaipur lies the Amer Fort, one of the most magnificent palaces in
                India. Also commonly
                known as the Amber Fort, this majestic building with its maze-like passages and serpentine staircases is
                an
                architectural masterpiece and with significant importance in Indian history. Only 11 kilometres away
                from Jaipur, Amer
                Fort is clad in pink and yellow sandstone and is a part of an extensive complex. Built by one of the
                most trusted
                generals of Akbar, Maharaja Man Singh I in the year 1592, Amer Fort served as the main residence of the
                Rajput Rulers.
                <br><br>
                The Amer Fort through its large ramparts, several gateways and paved paths overlooks the Maotha Lake in
                the town of
                Amer, which used to serve as the capital of the erstwhile Jaipur princely state. The fort is big enough
                that it will
                take you at least two to three hours to explore it in detail, and you can also choose to avail of the
                audio guides to
                lead you through this fascinating building while explaining the history of the place. Getting an
                elephant ride up the
                stairs to the Amber Fort is also a popular tourist activity. The fort sees over five thousand visitors
                daily and
                rightfully, the Amer Fort was inducted into UNESCO World Heritage Site list as part of the "Hill Forts
                of Rajasthan"
                along with five other forts.

                <h4>Amer Fort History :</h4>
                <p>Amer city was a small town before the Kachwahas's rule, built by a small tribe named 'Meenas'. The
                    Amer fort gets its
                    name after Ambikeshwar, another name of Lord Shiva, however, the locals also believe that the name
                    has been derived
                    from
                    Amba, another name of Goddess Durga. Once named as Dhundar, the city was ruled by the Kachhawahas
                    during the 11th
                    century to the 16th century when ultimately the capital was moved to Jaipur.
                    <br><br>
                    It was in the year 1592 AD that Raja Man Singh built the fort with expansion and renovation efforts
                    carrying on for
                    the
                    next 150 years by his successors. The older palace named 'Kadimi Mahal' is regarded as the oldest
                    palace of the
                    country.
                    A small temple dedicated to his patron Goddess 'Sheela Mata' was also commissioned by Raja Man
                    Singh. With several
                    old
                    structures destroyed and new ones brought up, the Amer Fort stood against all the odds with great
                    fervour.

                <h4>Amer Fort Architecture :</h4>
                <p>Amer Fort has a traditional Hindu and Rajputana style of architecture. It is aesthetically crafted out of
                    marble and red
                    sandstone giving it a rustic and mysterious look. There are intricate paintings of ancient hunting
                    styles and portraits
                    of significant Rajput rulers. Amer Fort is divided into four sections, each adorned with its separate
                    entrance and
                    courtyard. The main entrance to the fort is called 'Suraj Pol' or Sun Gate which leads to the main
                    courtyard. An
                    east-facing gate, this entrance has its name owing to its position with respect to the rising sun.
                    Imposing stairways
                    would lead you to the palace complex to an impressive courtyard named 'Jaleb Chowk' while the steps to
                    the right lead to
                    Siladevi Temple. Jaleb Chowk was used by the army to display their war booty back in time where women
                    were allowed to
                    watch the proceedings only through the windows.
                    <br><br>
                    Diwan-e-Aam (Public Audience Hall) forms the second level of the Amer Fort. It is a massive hall open on
                    three sides.
                    With extensive mosaic glassworks, it stands on the support of two columns of pillars with mounted
                    elephants. The third
                    courtyard of the Amer Fort is around the royal quarters. Entrance to this level is through the Ganesh
                    Pol. 'Sheesh
                    Mahal' is the most beautiful attraction in the entire complex and is left to the entrance gate. The
                    walls and ceilings
                    have beautiful carvings of flowers and glass paintings. The Sheesh Mahal gives beautiful illusions and
                    you may hear
                    people discussing that if you lit two candles inside the hall, the ceilings feel like a thousand
                    glittering stars.
