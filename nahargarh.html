            <h3>Nahargarh Fort, Jaipur Overview</h3>

                <h4>History of Nahargarh Fort :</h4>
                <p>Marked with a plethora of important historical events, Nahargarh Fort was built by the founder of
                    Jaipur city, Maharaja
                    Sawai Jai Singh in the year 1734. Used as a summer retreat palace, this fort was never attacked in
                    its long and
                    illustrious history. However, it has been a site of major historical events such as the signing of
                    treaties with Maratha
                    forces in 18th century. It is also noticed that the construction of the fort was hindered by Rathore
                    prince, Nahar Singh
                    Bhomia, whose spirit was appeased by a temple devoted to him inside the fort. The fort has also been
                    known to provide
                    shelter to several Europeans during the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. The Nahargarh Palace underwent major
                    renovations in the
                    year 1868 when RajaSawai Ram Singh built a range of palace within the Nahargarh Fort. In popular
                    culture, Nahargarh has
                    been featured in many famous films such as 'Rang De Basanti' and 'Shuddh Desi Romance'.

                <h4>Architecture of Nahargarh Fort :</h4>
                <p>The fort exhibits a beautiful Indo-European architecture housing several beautiful structures inside.
                    As you enter the
                    fort through entrance gate called "Tadigate", you will find a temple dedicated to the Jaipur rulers
                    towards left.
                    Another temple devoted to the Rathore prince, Nahar Singh Bhomia also resides inside the complex.
                    Other than that you
                    will find a "Madhavendra Bhawan" built by Sawai Madho Singh. The structure is two storied building

                    toilets, kitchen
                    and store. Other attraction inside the palace includes Diwan-I-Aam, an open-air enclosure where the
                    king met his

                <h4>Sculpture Park at Nahargarh Palace :</h4>
                <p>The opulent Madhavendra Palace at Nahargarh Fort was built by Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II as his
                    luxurious retreat.
                    Two centuries post, curator Peter Nagy has adorned it with exquisite sculptures that capture the
                    indulgent past, giving
                    birth to Sculpture Park. This joint project between the Government of Rajasthan and the NGO Saat Saath
                    Arts opened to
                    the public since 10 December 2017, becoming a space for the contemporary artists to showcase their work.
                    It houses 53
                    artworks by 24 top artists, including Indian and international.
                    <br><br>
                    The larger, striking sculptures have been placed in the royal courtyard which gleams with an exuberant
                    beauty. The regal
                    palace is symmetrical from the inside but confusing to explore, yet it brings forth a sense of awe and
                    wonder. The
                    sculptures housed inside the palace are smaller yet equally, even more so, astounding. The Sculpture
                    Park is an annual
                    exhibition, which means the artworks will be replaced by November 2018, bringing forth a fresh new
                    narrative.
