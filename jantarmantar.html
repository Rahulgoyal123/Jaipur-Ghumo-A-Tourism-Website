            <h3>Jantar Mantar, Jaipur Overview</h3>
            <p>Located near the City Palace in the regal city of Jaipur, Jantar Mantar is the largest stone astronomical
                observatory in
                the world. Owing to its rich cultural, heritage and scientific value, Jantar Mantar in Jaipur has also been
                featured on
                UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites. This ancient study boasts of nineteen instruments built out of stone
                and brass
                and was built by Raja Sawai Jai Singh in 1727-33. The intelligent construction and placement of these
                instruments
                allowed the observers to note the position of heavenly bodies with their naked eye alone. Time has failed to
                lay dust
                upon this engineering marvel and it still works as well as it used to in the olden times.
                <br><br>
                The main objective of building this vast observatory was to study and gather information about space and
                time. The
                instruments here pertain to the Egyptian study of Ptolemaic astronomy and follows three classical celestial
                coordinates
                to track the positions of heavenly bodies- namely the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial system and
                the
                ecliptic system. Another fact that makes this destination unique is that the world's largest sundial is
                situated here.
                The observatory in Jaipur is a part of a collection of five other such observatories built by Raja Jai
                Singh, which are
                located in New Delhi, Ujjain, Varanasi and Mathura. The best experience here is undoubtedly the light and
                sound show
                that takes place every evening and Jantar Mantar lights up like a firefly!

                <h4>History of Jantar Mantar :</h4>
                <p>Sawai Jai Singh was an accomplished scholar himself and was commissioned the task of confirming and
                    rectifying the
                    current data available on the movement of celestial bodies by Emperor Muhammad Shah. Jai Singh wanted to
                    refine the
                    ancient Islamic zij tables so that the exact hour of the day could be determined. Eventually, he wanted
                    to define a
                    precise calendar and make accurate astrological predictions for both individual and social benefit. To
                    achieve this, he
                    decided to build Jantar Mantar in the year 1718. He made extensive studies on the astronomical
                    principles of Hindu,
                    European, Islamic and Persian civilizations and built five different observatories across North India.
                    The construction
                    of Jaipur's Jantar Mantar took place in the period between 1727 and 1733 and was renovated time and
                    again. The
                    instruments here were built such that they covered a very wide range of cosmological applications which
                    further
                    accelerated developments in this field. It got featured on UNESCO's list of World Heritage in the year
                    2010 and has been
                    an even greater attraction ever since.

                <h4>Structure of Jantar Mantar :</h4>
                <p>The Jantar Mantar in Jaipur is a collection of different architectural and astronomical instruments. It
                    has 19 major
                    geometric devices for measuring time, predicting eclipses, ascertaining the declinations of planets,
                    determining
                    celestial altitudes and tracking stars in their orbits. This attraction is spread over an area of 18,700
                    meters and some
                    of the instruments here are the largest of their kind. Sawai Jai Singh II decided to build the
                    observatory instruments
                    with stone and marble because the stone can withstand extreme weather conditions much better as compared
                    to metal, which
                    has a tendency to wear and tear easily. Some of these instruments were conceptualized and designed by
                    the Raja himself.
                    On the other hand, a few of the instruments here are built from copper and still work with startling
                    accuracy. In terms
                    of its area, Jaipur's Jantar Mantar is the largest one as compared to its other counterparts in the
                    north of India.

                <h4>Instruments at Jantar Mantar :</h4>
                <p>The largest instrument here is the Samrat Yantra sundial which can give the local time with an accuracy
                    of up to 2
                    seconds. The structure is built from local stone and marble and each of these instruments carries an
                    astronomical scale.
                    However, the Samrat Yantra is not open to the public as observers still use it for their calculations.
                    There is a
                    smaller sundial present here which works on the same principle as the Samrat Yantra, and it is open for
                    the public to
                    use and explore. Ram Yantra is used to measure the local coordinates of altitude and azimuth of a
                    celestial object while
                    the Jai Prakash Yantra is used to find the position of heavenly monuments.
                    <br><br>
                    Other instruments here in the premises include Narivalya Yantra which remains parallel to the plane of
                    the Earths
                    equator, Karnti Yantram for measuring celestial latitude and celestial longitude of an object in the
                    sky, Raj Yantram
                    for the measurement of time and the positions of celestial objects, Unnsyhsmsa Yantra for measuring
                    altitude the angular
                    height of an object in the sky, Chakra Yantra for determining the global coordinates of declination and
                    the hour angle
                    of a celestial object, Disha Yantra, Dakshina Yantra and Rashayas Yantra. This observatory also employs
                    the "Kapala
                    Yantraprakara", which allows the transformation of one coordinate system to the other directly.

                <h4>Tips For Visiting Jantar Mantar :</h4>
                <p>1. If you are visiting during summers, try to visit this destination during the morning or evening hours.
                    <br><br>
                    2. Don't forget to carry a bottle of water with yourself to keep yourself hydrated.<br><br>
                    3. You must visit the orientation building here which has a short film giving a description of the
                    place.<br><br>
                    4. It is recommended that you hire a guide to understand the working of the instruments better.
                    Typically they charge
                    somewhere around INR 200.
