            <h3>City Palace Overview</h3>
            <p>The magnificent City Palace in Jaipur is one of the most famous tourist attractions located in the old part
                of the city.
                Built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh during the years 1729 to 1732, the vast complex of the palace occupied
                one-seventh of
                the walled city. In fact, it was once the seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur. The palace is divided into a
                series of
                courtyards, buildings and gardens including the Chandra Mahal and the Mubarak Mahal. The museum showcases
                various unique
                handcrafted products and other things that belong to the royal heritage of the City Palace.
                <br><br>
                The facade itself is designed with acute and detailed handiwork and showcases a blend of Mughal and Rajput
                architecture
                styles. The outer wall was built by Jai Singh II, however, the palace itself has been subjected to various
                changes over
                the course of time, with some of them even belonging to the early 20th century. The City Palace has three
                gates, out of
                which the Virendra Pol and Udai Pol are open to the public.

                <h4>History of City Palace :</h4>
                <p>The history of the palace is intertwined with the history of the great city of Jaipur itself. The City
                    palace used to be
                    the throne of the Maharaja of Jaipur, head of the Kachwaha Rajput Clan. Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh was the
                    force behind
                    the initiation of the Palace's construction when he began shifted the capital from Amber to Jaipur in
                    the year 1727. He
                    then began building the outer wall sometime during the years 1729 to 1732, such that it ran over to
                    several acres
                    through the city.
                    <br><br>
                    The Raja's death was followed by several wars between the Rajput kings, and Maharaja Ram Singh joined
                    forces with the
                    British during the Revolt of 1857 and proceeded to transform the city into in a medley of pink
                    structures so as to
                    welcome the Prince of Wales. The adopted son of Maharaja Madho Singh II, Raja Man Singh II was the last
                    king to rule
                    from the Chandra Mahal Palace. Post the merging of Jaipur with the Indian Union in 1949, the City Palace
                    continued to be
                    the residence of the royal family.

                <h4>Architecture of City Palace :</h4>
                <p>The architectural style of the City Palace was a fusion of the Shilpa Shastra of Indian Architecture
                    along with Rajput,
                    Mughal and European styles. The main architects for the construction of the palace were Vidyadhar
                    Bhattacharya and Sir
                    Samuel Swinton Jacob. Classical Indian principles such as the Vastushastra were promptly followed by the
                    architects
                    during the construction of the palace. It was built using red and pink sandstone and has three gates,
                    namely 'Tripolia
                    Gate', 'Udai Pol', 'Virendra Pol'. The entrances themselves are decorated intricately with the finest
                    handiwork and are
                    a suitable preamble to what lies inside. The palace complex is designed in the form of a grid and has a
                    number of
                    structures within its bounds such as 'Chandra Mahal', 'Govind Dev Ji Temple', 'Mubarak Mahal', and
                    'Diwan-I-Khas'.
                    Murals, mosaics, honeycomb window panes and meticulous stonework make the Palace a perfect blend of
                    design, art, colour
                    and culture.

                <h4>Inside the City Palace :</h4>
                <p>Mubarak Mahal: An amalgam of Mubarak Mahal, Islamic, Rajput and European architectural styles, the City
                    Palace was built
                    by Maharaja Madho Singh II in the late 19th century. It mainly acted as a reception centre and has now
                    been converted
                    into a museum. Some of the artefacts and articles stored here include royal formal costumes, Sanganeri
                    block prints,
                    embroidered shawls, Kashmiri pashminas and silk saris and ornamental clothes worn by Sawai Madho Singh
                    I.
                    <br><br>
                    Chandra Mahal: The Chandra Mahal is a remarkable edifice located towards the west end of the City
                    Palace. A charming
                    Peacock Gate welcomes you into the palace. The Mahal itself is decorated with beautiful paintings,
                    floral embellishments
                    and decorative mirror work. The building has seven floors with each of the floors having a unique name
                    such as
                    Sukh-Niwas, Ranga-Mandir, Pitam-Niwas, Chabi-Niwas, Shri-Niwas and Mukut Mahal. Most of this palace
                    serves as the
                    residence of the descendants of the regal family, however, the ground floor of the building serves as a
                    museum. Some of
                    the articles exhibited here are carpets, manuscripts and other items that belonged to the royal family.
                    <br><br>
                    Various sections of the City Palace are unique in their own way. The "Sukh Nivas" is painted blue in
                    colour and is
                    decorated with white lining. Mughal motifs, silver and glass dining tables and other ornamentations are
                    present in the
                    dining room here. The "Rang Mandir" has mirrors of all sizes in its walls, pillars and ceiling. "Shobha
                    Nivas" is
                    decorated with mirror walls and blue tiles which are further embellished with mica and gold leaf.
                    "Chhavi Nivas" is the
                    monsoon retreat of the Maharaja.
                    <br><br>
                    Pritam Niwas Chowk: It is towards the inner parts of the City Palace and has four small gates which lead
                    to the Chandra
                    Mahal. The gates themselves are decorated with illustrations that represent the four seasons and Hindu
                    deities Lord
                    Vishnu, Lord Shiva-Parvati, Lord Ganesha and Goddess Devi.

                    art gallery.

                    litres on display
                    here. These vessels were used by Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II to carry the water of the holy Ganges to
                    drink on his
                    trip to England. A number of shimmering crystal chandeliers are also present here, which is unveiled
                    only during special
                    occasions.

                    Diwan - i - Khas: Diwan-E-Khas was the 'Hall of Private Audience', and is a vibrant example of the
                    architecture of that
                    time. The ceiling is painted in shades of red and gold which have a flawless appearance even to this
                    day. This edifice
                    is a major attraction within the palace itself. converted into an art gallery, the Diwan- i- Khas
                    exhibits miniature
                    paintings, ancient texts, embroidered rugs, Kashmir shawls and carpets. Handwritten original manuscripts
                    of Hindu
                    scriptures and the Royal throne called as 'Takht-e-Rawal' also find a place here.
                    <br><br>
                    Maharani Palace: Originally, this served as the residence of the queens, but has now been converted into
                    a museum.
                    Weapons used by the royalty during the war are on display here, with some of them as old as the 15th
                    century. The
                    ceiling is again decorated beautifully with the dust of precious and semi precious stones.
                    <br><br>
                    Bhaggi Khana: This is the museum which has an exquisite collection of old carriages, palanquins and
